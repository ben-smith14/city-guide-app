# city-guide-app
This is an Android app that simulates the front-end design and functionality of a simple tour guide app for the city of Bath in the UK. As it does not interact with any sort of database of locations, a number of test sets were manually created and added.

It was the fourth significant task assigned to us in the Android Basics Nanodegree on udacity.com. The app works correctly in both portrait and landscape mode, although this is not reflected in the initial images below.
